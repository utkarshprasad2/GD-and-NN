# GD-and-NN

In this project, I utilized various python libraries in order to set up a controlled neural network that trains on a vast amount of data in terms of epochs and is able to predict outputted digits to a 97.31% accuracy.

In the other part of my project, I worked on a gradient descent algorithm using the numpy, linalg, and matplotlib python libraries in order to reduce test loss in terms of the ADAM algorithm.
